To use the argoverse-hd dataset, you need to first download the data from the following link and put the zipped contents into "DL-reweighting/dataset-ninja". For the binary test you just need to put two classes in the xxx_biased folders like the example binary data .zip. Note that the "0 class" will be the class that is alphabetically first.
